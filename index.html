              Let me introduce myself ... My name is Leon ≈†krilec. I am 28 years
              old. I graduated from Social Informatics last year and currently I
              work as a freelance web developer and I am one of three
              co-founders at our latest and greatest project Kam za vikend, a
              project which I will be talking about today.

          <h2>What will I be talking about today?</h2>
          <p>
            In this ~30 minute lecture I would like to show you how we went from
            an idea to efficient digital product.
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Earlier this year me and my two co-founders launched a website
              called ‚ÄúKam za vikend‚Äù which aims to give people unique trip ideas
              and information about local sights and things to do. Our product
              is performing very well, users spent a lot of time on a website
              and we already made some money selling advertising slots on the
              website.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my ~30 minute lecture today I will be giving you an overview on
              how we went from an idea to an efficient digital product. I will
              walk you through the process of ideating, prototyping, designing
              and testing a digital product. We will be going through a process
              step-by-step, from an initial insight to a minimum viable produt
              (MVP).
            </p>
            <p>
              I think this will be very valuable to you since you were hearing
              mostly theoretical concepts about web design throughout this
              semester (Andra≈æ correct me if I am wrong üôÇ) and I will be giving
              you mostly practical tips on how to implement them in real world.
            </p>
            <p>
              And I think this is also going to be a joy for me to remind myself
              of all the problems we solved, all the obstacles we faced and all
              the hours we put into this project.

          <h3>... rewind back to 2019 ...</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Now lets rewind to the year 2019 to the start of our product
              development process. Slovenia was right in the middle of lockdown,
              people were stuck in their municipalities because of the
              government restrictions and there were a lot of bad mood and
              uncertainty among Slovenian public. A lot of people also opposed
              the government with their regulations. That is why I decided to
              build some sort of social responsible Aprils fool joke.

              It obviously is a joke and I hope this app encouraged some people
              to stay at home. But the real insight I got when people started
              commenting that the app is not working. That they have inputted 5
              or 6 different cities and still did not get the results. Then it
              struck me. Maybe people really need that kind of app? üôÇ¬†I
              partnered up with my former collegue Ana and we went on pursuing
              this idea.

                Armed with useful information about the people whose problem we
                were trying to solve, we started with digital product
                development process step 2: **Prototyping.**
              </p>
              <p>
                The main goal of this step is to develop a prototype of your
                proposed solution, test it, gather feedback from your users and
                iterate, improving your prototype until you are satisfied with
                the solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is very helpful to imagine how people will be using your
                product and who this people will be. For that purpose you can
                create imaginary personas and describe their journey (user flow)
                using your solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prototypes usually go from very low fidelity (lo-fi) - sketches,
                storyboards, scribbles - to high fidelity (hi-fi) - detailed
                wireframes of proposed solution.

                It is also important that you try to define a minimum viable
                product in this stage. This is particularly hard, because in
                this stage you want to include every possbile functionality in
                your product. But you have to be aware, that it is better to
                build a reliable product with fewer functionalities than
                unreliable one with plenty of functionalities. You really have
                to strip your product to its essentials and deliver most value
                with minimum effort.

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                For Kam za vikend we knew that we have to build some kind of a
                collection of trip ideas but we did not know exactly what is the
                optimal flow for users to interact with that collection. That‚Äôs
                why we imagined 10 users, we desribed them thoroughly and we
                imagined their usage of our solution.

                Even only from these three personas you can see, that each of
                them has unique problem and would prefer a unique solution. The
                main challenge here is to define a prototype that would
                efficiently solve a problem for as many people as possible.

                Protoyping is iterative process. We went from most lo-fi
                prototypes to the final wireframe in 2 months. We gathered a lot
                of feedback from actual users throughout the process. We learned

                So we had our prototype and we tested in on different users to
                see if user journey flow is clear and that it makes sense to our
                users. Now it is time to tackle the third step of product
                development process: **Visual design.**
              </p>

              <p>
                Visual design is all about implementing colors, typography,
                images, spacings in a way that enhances a design or interaction.

              <p>
                If we look at Aarron Walters hierarchy of needs which is quite
                similar to Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy in psychology, we can see, that
                product must first be functional and reliable, only then can we
                worry about making it usable and pleasurable. Visual design is
                all about making product more usable and pleasurable.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make product usable the designer should bring user‚Äôs
                attention to the right infromation and functionality, using
                different sizing, colors and typography. Important elements in
                the interface should be highlighted so user can seamlessly move
                through the journey.

                We created 2 interactive prototypes of a homepage - one for
                desktop users and one for mobile users - and started with
                usability interviews. We showed the prototype to at least 15
                different people, observing their interactions and asking them
                many questions about their experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                We learned a lot from these interviews and came to the final

                We conducted many interviews again to test the final design
                proposal and it showed much less friction in user journey as did
                the previous versions. We were happy to proceed with our final
                version.

            <aside class="notes">
              You have to think about your product KPIs. What metrics should we
              measure? Of course there are a lot of metrics that can tell you if
              your product is performing well - some of these metrics are:
              Number of users, time spent on page, bounce rate, traffic
              acqusition channels and others. But most importantly each product
              has to have a north star metric. This is metric that is the most
              important one and is directly linked to business success.

                We are still figuring out what the north star metric will be for

                advertising business model our north star metric will probably
                be either traffic (number of users on our site) or time each
                user spends on page.

                One other thing you need to figure out is SEO optimization. If
                you plan to acquire users through organic search (Google) you
                need to have some sort of SEO optimization in mind. You have to
                think about what your potential users will google for and then
                optimise your content accordingly.

                For Kam za vikend, Google brings in the most traffic (34%),

                keywords people are seraching for and on which position we rank
                among google search results. We can thus see, for which keywords
                must we optimise.

                We have also learned that we can not gather all the infromation

                be giving more control to our users. We will give them an
                opportunity to create content with us and help us build the
                biggest trip ideas database in Slovenia.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also plan to expand content categories, adding a lot of ideas
                that are currently not supported. Ideas for commercial tourist
                activities for example rafting, bungee jumping, ziplines etc. We
                intentionally left these ideas out, because we have to think
                about how will we monetize these ideas.

                many doors for us, since we will be able to use mobile cameras
                and location services to prompt users about relevant trip ideas
                around them.

                We are also looking into the recent hype about Web 3.0. We are
                looking for different possibilities on how to give users an
                opportunity to earn income by creating content on our platform.
                This certainly has become easier with payment platforms like
                Stripe or with blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.
